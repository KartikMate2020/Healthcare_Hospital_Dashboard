<h1>🏥 Healthcare Data Dashboard</h1> 

This project features an interactive Healthcare Data Dashboard developed to visualize and analyze critical metrics from healthcare datasets. Built using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Python-based dashboards (e.g., Streamlit or Plotly Dash), the dashboard offers meaningful insights into patient demographics, hospital performance, treatment outcomes, and resource utilization.

The purpose of the dashboard is to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare, enabling stakeholders such as hospital administrators, policy-makers, or analysts to monitor trends, identify inefficiencies, and improve care delivery.
